                <p>Founded in 1746, Princeton University in Princeton, New Jersey, is one of the oldest and most prestigious universities in the United States. Originally established as the College of New Jersey, it became Princeton University in 1896 and has since become a leader in research and undergraduate education.

                    Princeton is renowned for its commitment to providing a rigorous academic experience with a focus on undergraduate education, offering close faculty mentorship and a liberal arts approach. Its motto, "Dei Sub Numine Viget" (Under the Protection of God She Flourishes), reflects the institution’s values of academic rigor, integrity, and service.

                <p>The academic rigor at Princeton is unmatched, but the pressure can be immense. The constant expectation to excel academically can be overwhelming, and sometimes it feels like there's no room for personal time or relaxation.
