                <p>Founded in 1769, Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire, is one of the oldest Ivy League institutions. Originally established to educate Native American youth, Dartmouth has since evolved into a prestigious institution known for its strong focus on undergraduate education and commitment to fostering leadership, critical thinking, and service.

                    Dartmouth offers a unique liberal arts experience, with a tight-knit community that fosters close relationships between students and faculty. The college is known for its outdoor activities, strong academic programs, and emphasis on undergraduate research.

                <p>While Dartmouth offers a great academic experience, the social scene can be a bit limited. The small size of the school can make it feel somewhat isolated at times, and the pressure to fit in can be overwhelming for some.

                <p>While Dartmouth offers an exceptional education, I often feel that the campus can be too insular. It’s easy to get lost in the ‘Dartmouth bubble,’ and sometimes it feels like we don’t engage enough with the broader world outside of our small community.

                <p>Dartmouth’s tight-knit community is what makes it special. The professors really care about your success, and the access to research opportunities is fantastic. The campus is beautiful, and being in such a close-knit environment allows for deep connections.
