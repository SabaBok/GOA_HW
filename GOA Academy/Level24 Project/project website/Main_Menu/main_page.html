                Founded in 1973 by Gabriel, a proud patriot of the village of Fasanauri, our winery is as rich as the land it comes from. Gabriel's passion for wine began on his family's vineyard land in Fasanauri, where he grew his vines and developed a deep connection to the region. Gabriel, who decided to capture the spirit of his homeland in every bottle, created a unique secret ingredient - a closely guarded element that has become the hallmark of our wine.
                When he confided this secret, he passed on not only a family recipe, but also a part of Fasanauri's soul. Over the years, our company has grown, but we remain deeply connected to Gabriel's cherished traditions. His unwavering commitment to quality, community and homeland is reflected in every bottle we produce, honoring the essence of Fasanauri and our family's undying love for winemaking.
                As we share our wines with the world, we carry Gabriel's legacy forward, preserving the history that began in the vineyards of Fasanauri and continues to flourish today.</p>
